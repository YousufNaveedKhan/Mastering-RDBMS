# Mastering RDBMS - Lecture #4

## Database Relationships and Keys

In this lecture, we will explore the key concepts that form the backbone of relational databases: **Keys** and **Relationships**. These are essential for maintaining data integrity, linking tables, and making data retrieval easier.

### **What is a Primary Key?**
A **Primary Key** is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures:
1. No two rows have the same primary key value.
2. The column (or combination of columns) with the primary key cannot contain `NULL`.

**Example in Practice**:  
In the provided MySQL and SQL Server scripts, the `Authors` table uses the `AuthorID` column as the primary key:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    AuthorID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Primary Key ensures unique AuthorID
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

---

### **What is a Foreign Key?**
A **Foreign Key** links two tables by referencing the primary key in another table. This relationship ensures consistency between related data.

**Example in Practice**:  
In the `Books` table, the `AuthorID` column is a foreign key that refers to the `AuthorID` in the `Authors` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    AuthorID INT, -- This is the Foreign Key
    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID)
);
```
This means each book must have a valid `AuthorID` that exists in the `Authors` table.

---

### **What is a Unique Key?**
A **Unique Key** ensures that all values in a column are unique. Unlike the primary key, a unique key allows `NULL` values.

**Example in Practice**:  
In the `Authors` table, the `Email` column is defined as `UNIQUE`:
```sql
Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE -- Ensures no two authors have the same email
```

## Relationships in Databases

Relational databases allow you to connect data across tables using relationships. Here are the common types:

### **1. One-to-One Relationship**
- One record in Table A is linked to one record in Table B.
- **Example**: A `User` table and a `Profile` table, where each user has exactly one profile.

### **2. One-to-Many Relationship**
- One record in Table A is linked to multiple records in Table B.
- **Example in Practice**:  
   - An author can write multiple books.
   - The `Books` table uses the `AuthorID` foreign key to create this relationship.

### **3. Many-to-Many Relationship**
- Multiple records in Table A are linked to multiple records in Table B.
- Requires a **junction table** to store the relationship.
- **Example**: Students and Courses, where each student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students.

## Practical Demonstration

### **Tables Created**
1. **Authors**: Contains author details with a unique `AuthorID`.
2. **Books**: Stores book details, linking each book to an author via the `AuthorID` foreign key.
3. **Reviews**: Stores reviews for books, linking each review to a book via the `BookID` foreign key.

### **Inserting Data**
We inserted data into the tables to demonstrate relationships. For example:
```sql
-- Adding a book with an author
INSERT INTO Books (Title, AuthorID) VALUES ('MySQL Basics', 1);
```

### **Query Examples**

1. **Fetching Books and their Authors**:  
   Using a `JOIN` to retrieve book titles along with author names:
   ```sql
   SELECT Books.Title, Authors.Name AS AuthorName
   FROM Books
   JOIN Authors ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;
   ```

2. **Fetching Reviews with Book Titles**:  
   Linking reviews with books to show which review belongs to which book:
   ```sql
   SELECT Reviews.ReviewText, Books.Title
   FROM Reviews
   JOIN Books ON Reviews.BookID = Books.BookID;
   ```

## Key Points and Professional Tips
1. Always use **Primary Keys** to uniquely identify each row in your table.
2. Use **Foreign Keys** to ensure data integrity between related tables.
3. Define **Unique Keys** for columns that should not have duplicate values, like emails.
4. Use proper **naming conventions** for keys (e.g., `AuthorID`, `BookID`) to make your database easy to understand.
5. Relationships should always reflect the real-world structure of your data.
6. Use `JOIN` statements effectively to retrieve related data from multiple tables.

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated in the Scripts
- **Creating Tables** with Primary, Foreign, and Unique Keys.
- **Establishing Relationships** (One-to-Many in this lecture).
- **Inserting Data** to demonstrate relationships in action.
- **Writing Queries** using `JOIN` to fetch related data.
- **CHECK Constraints** (in SQL Server) to validate data inputs.
