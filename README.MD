# Mastering RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

## Overview

In the field of database management, Database Management Systems (DBMS) are crucial for efficiently managing and manipulating data. DBMSs can be broadly classified into two types:

1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**
2. **Non-Relational DBMS**

A **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is a type of DBMS that structures data into tables, with relationships defined between these tables to ensure data integrity and support complex queries.

### Examples of RDBMS:

- **MySQL**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Oracle**
- **IBM DB2**

## Repository Contents

This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive course on **MySQL** and **Microsoft SQL Server**, two widely used RDBMS platforms. The course covers fundamental and advanced topics, with each lecture focusing on a specific aspect of RDBMS.

### Course Outline

Below is the list of lectures included in this course. Each lecture is accompanied by:

- **Two SQL Files**: One for MySQL and one for SQL Server.
- **Lecture Guide**: A detailed README file explaining the topic and SQL scripts.
