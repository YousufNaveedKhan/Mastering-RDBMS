# Mastering RDBMS - Lecture #13: NoSQL Integration and Hybrid Systems

## **Overview of NoSQL Databases**
In this lecture, we explore **NoSQL databases** and their integration with **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** to form **hybrid systems**.

### **What are NoSQL Databases?**
NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are highly scalable and can be more flexible than traditional RDBMS in terms of data models and operations.

#### **Types of NoSQL Databases**
1. **Document Stores**: These databases store data in the form of documents, typically using JSON or BSON formats. Examples include **MongoDB** and **CouchDB**.
2. **Key-Value Stores**: These are simple databases where data is stored as a key-value pair. Examples include **Redis** and **Riak**.
3. **Column Stores**: These databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them suitable for analytical queries. Examples include **Cassandra** and **HBase**.
4. **Graph Databases**: These databases focus on relationships between data entities, often used for social networks or recommendation engines. Examples include **Neo4j** and **ArangoDB**.

#### **Advantages of NoSQL Databases**
1. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases can easily scale horizontally, adding more servers as the database grows.
2. **Flexibility**: They support a variety of data models (e.g., document, graph, key-value), making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
3. **Performance**: NoSQL databases are optimized for high-performance reads and writes, especially in distributed systems.

#### **Limitations of NoSQL Databases**
1. **Lack of Standardization**: Unlike RDBMS, NoSQL databases do not follow a single, consistent query language like SQL.
2. **ACID Compliance**: Most NoSQL databases do not fully comply with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which might lead to data consistency issues in some use cases.

## **Integrating RDBMS with NoSQL for Hybrid Systems**
Many modern applications require a combination of RDBMS and NoSQL systems to leverage the strengths of both.

### **Hybrid Systems**
In a **hybrid system**, you can integrate an RDBMS (such as **MySQL** or **SQL Server**) with a NoSQL database to store data efficiently and effectively, based on the specific needs of the application.

- **Example Use Case**: An e-commerce application might use an RDBMS to store customer orders and transactions (where ACID compliance is essential), while using a NoSQL database to store product catalogs, user reviews, and recommendations (where scalability and flexibility are crucial).

### **Integration Approaches**
1. **Data Syncing**: Data can be periodically synced between the RDBMS and NoSQL systems using batch jobs or real-time data replication techniques.
2. **Polyglot Persistence**: Different data stores are used for different parts of an application, based on the data requirements. This approach leverages the best tools for specific use cases.

### **Challenges in Integration**
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring consistency across different systems can be complex. Techniques such as **eventual consistency** and **CAP theorem** are often used to manage this.
- **Complex Queries**: Querying data across multiple systems requires careful planning, as NoSQL databases may not support complex joins or SQL-like queries.

## **Conclusion**
This lecture provided an introduction to NoSQL databases and their integration with RDBMS for building hybrid systems. We discussed the advantages and limitations of NoSQL, as well as potential approaches for integrating these systems in modern applications. 

NoSQL and RDBMS integration enables applications to meet diverse needs such as scalability, performance, and flexibility, all while maintaining the structure and consistency that relational databases provide.

### **Important Note**
In this lecture, we have not provided practical source code examples for NoSQL integration. This lecture is intended to give you an understanding of the concepts and approaches related to NoSQL and RDBMS hybrid systems.
